# Maze Generator

This is a simply maze generator I wrote for our study group at Booking.

# Running it

You need to provide a width and a height:

    ruby main.rb width height

This mode creates a GTK window with the maze.

You may also provide a filename:

    ruby main.rb width height out.png

This renders the maze to `out.png`.
